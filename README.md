# Getting Started

1. setup the airavata-django-portal locally. See
    https://github.com/apache/airavata-django-portal.

    Then, activate the virtual environment for the airavata-django-portal:
    
    ```
    cd ../airavata-django-portal
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. In order to replicate some data for interactwel, there's a dataset provided on this repository
    You need to add or replace the `db.sqlite3` in the directory airavata-django-portal with `db.sqlite3`
    provided in the `data` directory.

3. Change to the directory of this project and install this project as a
    python package in the airavata-django-portal's virtual environment:
    ```
    cd ../interactactwel-django-app/
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    ```
    Note: `python setup.py develop` also builds the Vue JS app.
    
4. Go back to the airavata-django-portal and start the server
    ```
    cd ../airavata-django-portal
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
5. Browse `http://localhost:8000/` and login to the portal.
6. Browse the `db.sqlite3` in airavata-django-portal through a sqlite database browser
    and change the `username`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `email` columns in `interactwel_user` table.
    So, that the interactwel data would be linked to your login.

7. The InterACTWEL Dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8000/interactwel/ with data.
